# Goose Database

This repository is for the development of the goose database system. While goose may be an acronym, nobody is exactly sure what it stands for. Frontend code and scraping scripts will live here, at least until they become the most awesome recipe database ever.

When developing, you will need to insert your credentials in the config.js file. It should look like the following, where user and pass are your username and password:
```
host: "pma.horine.dev",
user: "user",
password: "pass",
database: "recipes"
```
